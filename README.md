## `jesus-related`
i'm a practicing Christian so i started out w making emojis for my college ministry's discord server. this folder just contains emojis in that category.

## `animals`
pretty straightforward, but yeah, animals. most cat edits will probably be here, unless they got overlap with another category. i'll figure out tagging and whatnot in the future.

## `fandom`
various edits related to different fandoms. depends mainly on what i feel like doing and what requests i decide to take.

- `bg3` Baldur's Gate 3
- `fairy-tail` Fairy Tail (2006/2009)
